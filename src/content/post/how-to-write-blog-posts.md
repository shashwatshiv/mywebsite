## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and publishing blog posts on this website. We use Markdown (`.md`) and MDX (`.mdx`) files for writing posts, which makes it easy to create well-formatted content with rich features.

## File Structure

Blog posts are stored in the `src/content/post/` directory. Each post is a separate file with either a `.md` or `.mdx` extension. The filename becomes part of the URL for your post.

## Front Matter

Every blog post starts with front matter - a YAML section at the top of the file that contains metadata about your post. Here's what it looks like:

```yaml

publishDate: 2024-01-25T00:00:00Z
title: Your Blog Post Title
excerpt: A brief description of your post that appears in previews
image: https://url-to-your-header-image.jpg
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

### Required Fields

- `publishDate`: The publication date in ISO format
- `title`: The title of your blog post
- `excerpt`: A short description (shown in previews)
- `image`: Header image URL
- `tags`: Array of relevant tags

## Writing Content

After the front matter, you can write your post content using Markdown syntax.

### Basic Markdown Syntax

```markdown
# H1 Heading

## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

**Bold text**
_Italic text_

- Bullet point
- Another point

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

[Link text](URL)

![Image alt text](image-url)
```

### Code Blocks

For code snippets, use triple backticks with the language specified:

\```javascript
function hello() {
console.log("Hello, World!");
}
\```

### Using MDX Features

If you're using an `.mdx` file, you can import and use React components:

```jsx
import MyComponent from '~/components/MyComponent';

<MyComponent prop="value" />;
```

## Adding Images

1. Place your images in `src/assets/images/`
2. Reference them in your post:
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](~/assets/images/your-image.jpg)
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Filenames**: Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `my-blog-post.md`)
2. **Optimize Images**: Compress images before uploading
3. **Structure Content**: Use headings to organize your content logically
4. **Add Tags**: Include relevant tags to help with content discovery
5. **Preview**: Test your post locally before publishing

## Publishing

1. Create your post file in `src/content/post/`
2. Add the front matter and content
3. Commit and push to the repository
4. The site will automatically rebuild and deploy your new post

## Example Post Structure

Here's a complete example of a blog post:
